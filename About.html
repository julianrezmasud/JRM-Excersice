      The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup is an international
      association football competition contested by the senior men's national
      team of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football
      Association (Fifa), the sport's global governing body. The tournament has
      been held every four years since the inaugural tournament in1930 except in
      1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the second world war The
      reigning champions are Argentina, who won their third title at the 2022
      tournament. The format involves a qualification phase which takes place
      over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the
      tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 32 teams compete for the title
      at venues within the host nation(s) over about a month. The host nation(s)
      automatically qualify to the group stage of the tournament. The FIFA World
      Cup has been scheduled to expand to 48 teams for the 2026 tournament. As
      of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, 22 final tournaments have been held and a
      total of 80 national teams have competed. The trophy has been won by eight
      national teams. Brazil, with five wins, are the only team to have played
      in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are Germany and Italy,
      with four titles each; Argentina, with three titles; France and inaugural
      winner Uruguay each with two titles; and England and Spain, with one title
      each. The World Cup is the most prestigious association football
      tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and followed
      single sporting event in the world. The viewership of the 2018 World Cup
      was estimated to be 3.57 billion (close to half of the global population),
      while the engagement with 2022 World Cup was estimated to be around 5
      billion with close to 1.5 billion people watching the final match.
      Seventeen countries have hosted the World Cup, most recently Qatar, who
      hosted the 2022 edition. The 2026 tournament will be jointly hosted by
      Canada, the United States and Mexico, which will give Mexico the
      distinction of being the first country to host games in three World Cups.
